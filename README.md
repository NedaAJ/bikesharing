## Overview of Analysis
The goal of this study is to come up with a plan that will convince investors to fund a bike-sharing scheme in Des Moines, Iowa. We were able to construct visuals based on the supplied statistics to illustrate average bike length trends and the links between gender and popular biking times. This series of visualization, in particular:

- Show the amount of time that all riders and genders have their bikes checked out.
- For each hour of each day of the week, display the number of bike journeys for all riders and genders.
- For each day of the week, display the number of bike journeys for each kind of user and gender.
